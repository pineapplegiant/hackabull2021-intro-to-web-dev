## Hi I'm G-mo ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name's Guillermo Rodriguez. I graduated from USF in 2018 with a chemical engineering degree but decided I thought coding was cooler so I switched.
Currently, I'm taking CS classes online at Oregon State University and work as a Frontend Developer for a company called SearchSpring here in Denver, Colorado.

I've been *trying* to give workshops at Hackabull every year so no use in stopping now.

Here's a picture of me in a pizza suit:
