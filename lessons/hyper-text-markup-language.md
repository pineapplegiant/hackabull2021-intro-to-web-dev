The basics of HTML

## Boilerplate

HTML is lowkey old af. Browsers are also super old so like you have to tell them a few things, like that you're speaking in English.

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
      <link href="myStyleSheet.css" rel="stylesheet">
      <title>Basic HTML BOILERPLATE</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
  </html>
```
