## All good things must end




### Where do I go from here??

Keep Learning!

Some of my favorite learning resources:

[Don't forget about the student developer pack!!](https://education.github.com/pack)

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) - I think much better than Codeacademy imo.
- [Frontend Master's](https://frontendmasters.com/) - REALLY good Frontend content from really smart people. Take advantage of your student developer pack with this one.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - The old busted. It's pretty good, and a huge communtity of chill people.
- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Kinda basic, like just syntax. But it's kinda fun.

My hote take - Don't pay for learning resources. And be wary of tutorial hell. Go out and build the thing!

Go forth and follow your coding dreams.

Thank you!!
