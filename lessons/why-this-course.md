## Web Development is accessible!

All you need is a browser and a text editor and you can start coding for the internet!

I wanted to create this course because (I enjoy teaching and) I think Web Development is particularly approachable for coding. A lot of other branches of software Engineering involve lots of tooling (AKA setting up stuff to do the things), and or are platform specific (like you need an iPhone or a Mac to make iPhone apps kinda thing), etc.

I'd argue that most people in this room have probably used the internet at least once in there lives, and probably have a browser, so I think it's familiar enough to get you going!

**My goal is to get you started programming**, and remember everyone gets stuck! All of this stuff was made up by someone else anyway, so it's not always intuitive, so don't be too hard on yourself.

Please, please, please ask questions along the way!

Other Things you'll hopefully learn on the way: 
- Random tricks for coding on the web
- Keyboard shortcuts maybe?
- The dev tools.
