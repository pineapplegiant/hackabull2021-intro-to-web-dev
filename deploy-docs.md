## Lessons

The crux of this site is are the lessons. Provided are two examples. Each lesson needs a [frontmattter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/docs/docs/adding-markdown-pages.md#note-on-creating-markdown-files) `path`, `order`, and `title`. Generally you should make the `path` and the file name match for ease of finding it.

- `path` - needs a leading slash. This will be slug of the lesson
- `title` - will be the title displayed on the Table of Contents and on the page itself
- `order` - the order of which the item should appear in the table of contents. should in `<number><capital letter>` format where the number corresponds to the section it's and the letter corresponds to the order of the lesson inside the section, e.g. `3B`
- `section` - the title of the section that the article is in. Only the first lesson for each section will be used.
- `description` â€“ a one-to-three sentence summary of the lesson. used for the meta tag for social shares and SEO. if no description is given, the `siteMetadata.description` for the site is used
